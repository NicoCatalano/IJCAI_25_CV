    My research lies at the intersection of Artificial Intelligence, Robotics, and Autonomous Systems, with a focus on Computer Vision. During my PhD at Politecnico di Milano, under the supervision of Prof. Matteo Matteucci, I investigated domain adaptation and learning from small data, focusing on scenarios where collecting and labeling large datasets is particularly challenging, such as agricultural robotics. In this context, I contributed to research on Few-Shot Segmentation  and Domain Adaptation, developing methods to improve segmentation performance with minimal supervision.

    To expand my expertise, I spent a research period at the Digital Signal Processing and Image Analysis lab at the University of Oslo, collaborating with Prof.Ad\'in Ram\'irez~Rivera on the analysis of Vision Transformer latent spaces for FSS and Semantic Segmentation using prototypical learning techniques. More recently, my research has evolved to explore the integration of Large Language Models with Computer Vision, leveraging textual information to enhance segmentation and video understanding tasks. This includes using multimodal approaches to refine segmentation predictions in Few-Shot Segmentation pipelines and incorporating language-driven reasoning for structured scene interpretation in video analysis.
