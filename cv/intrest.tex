My research revolves around tackling the challenges of Few-Shot Segmentation (FSS) and Semantic Segmentation, particularly in scenarios where data scarcity limits the effectiveness of traditional deep learning models. Through my work, I have explored ensemble learning techniques, demonstrating how combining multiple backbone networks can improve segmentation performance without requiring additional data. I have also investigated domain adaptation strategies, applying FSS to precision agriculture to develop models that remain robust under varying environmental conditions. More recently, I have been studying the potential of foundational models for segmentation tasks, examining how their pretrained representations can be leveraged and refined for data-efficient learning. My interest in model interpretability and multimodal approaches further drives my exploration of new methodologies that enhance segmentation accuracy and generalization across diverse applications.
